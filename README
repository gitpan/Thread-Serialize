README for Thread::Serialize

Library for data-structure serialization between threads.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions if threading has been enabled when building
Perl, or if the "forks" module has been installed on an unthreaded Perl.

Version:
 1.01

Required Modules:
 Storable (any)
 Test::More (0.88)

Installation:
This distribution contains two versions of the code: one maintenance version
for versions of perl < 5.014 (known as 'maint'), and the version currently in
development (known as 'blead').  The standard build for your perl version is:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

This will try to test and install the "blead" version of the code.  If the
Perl version does not support the "blead" version, then the running of the
Makefile.PL will *fail*.  In such a case, one can force the installing of
the "maint" version of the code by doing:

 perl Makefile.PL maint

Alternately, if you want automatic selection behavior, you can set the
AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD environment variable to a true value.  On Unix-like
systems like so:

 AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD=1 perl Makefile.PL

If your perl does not support the "blead" version of the code, then it will
automatically install the "maint" version of the code.

Please note that any additional parameters will simply be passed on to the
underlying Makefile.PL processing.
