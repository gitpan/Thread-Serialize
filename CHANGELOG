0.03	10 September 2002
	Removed the NOT_ICED environment variable hack and its documentation.
	Replaced by having an external Perl process calculate the Storable
	(iced) signature at load time.  This should be compatible with all
	versions of Storable on all possible OS's and hardware architectures.

	Now uses pre-frozen signature value unless told otherwise.  This saves
	Storable::freeze to have to be available in all threads.  Can be
	circumvented by specifying NOT_ICED environment variable.  Added
	OPTIMIZATIONS and CAVEATS sections to the pod.

	Added support for AutoLoader.  Together with all of the other Thread::
	modules, this should start saving a lot of memory.

	Removed reference tricks: we should find other ways of saving memory
	with threads.

0.01	13 August 2002
	First version of Thread::Serialize.
