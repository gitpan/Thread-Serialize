	Now uses pre-frozen signature value unless told otherwise.  This saves
	Storable::freeze to have to be available in all threads.  Can be
	circumvented by specifying NOT_ICED environment variable.  Added
	OPTIMIZATIONS and CAVEATS sections to the pod.

	Added support for AutoLoader.  Together with all of the other Thread::
	modules, this should start saving a lot of memory.

	Removed reference tricks: we should find other ways of saving memory
	with threads.

	First version of Thread::Serialize.
